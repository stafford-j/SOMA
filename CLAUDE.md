# Aldr Ecosystem Project Brief

## üö® **IMPORTANT NOTES:**
**IRISH DIASPORA MARKET STRATEGY** - This is background market research and founder-market fit analysis only. Do NOT include Irish references or culturally specific content in the actual application UI, copy, or marketing materials. This remains a private strategic consideration for go-to-market planning.

**ALDR HEALTH COLLEAGUE DEPLOYMENT** - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER push Aldr Health Colleague (provider platform) to demo/production without explicit approval. This platform is kept private and separate from public demos for now.

## Project Overview
The Aldr Ecosystem is a comprehensive document storage and health management platform that allows users to organize and manage important documents across three main categories: Health, Legal, and Identity. The project evolved from the original SOMA Companion application into a full-featured document vault system.

## Project Structure
The repository contains multiple integrated projects:

### Core Aldr Projects
1. **Aldr Vaults MVP** - `/aldr-vaults-mvp/` - Main homepage and navigation hub
2. **Aldr Health Companion** - `/aldr-health-companion/` - Personal health record management (formerly SOMA Companion)
3. **SOMA Colleague (Provider Platform)** - `/SOMA Colleague (Provider Platform)/` - Healthcare provider interface (maintained separately)

### Demo Projects
4. **Aldr Health Individual Full Demo** - `/aldr-health-individual-full-demo/` - Complete demo version
5. **Aldr Health Provider Full Demo** - `/aldr-health-provider-full-demo/` - Provider demo version

## Current Priority
**Today's Priority (June 25, 2025):** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Enhanced SmartSuggestions reminders component with improved urgency indicator positioning and readability

### üìã **COLONY CODEBASE INTEGRATION**

**Original Colony Project:**
- **Purpose:** Cross-platform desktop GUI for Autonomi network file operations
- **Technology:** Rust backend + Tauri framework (originally Slint, migrated to Svelte frontend)
- **Core Features:** Upload/download files, RDF metadata management, pod-based data organization
- **Architecture:** Client-side search using SPARQL queries, no servers/oracles
- **Data Model:** Uses RDF (TriG syntax) with pod/scratchpad system for emergent metadata discovery

**Colony Backend Components:**
- **DataStore:** File system management (`colonylib::data`)
- **KeyStore:** BIP39 seed phrase + BLS key management (`colonylib::key`) 
- **Graph:** RDF database using SPARQL (`colonylib::graph`) - stored in `graph.db`
- **PodManager:** Metadata pod creation/management (`colonylib::pod`)
- **Client:** Autonomi network operations (upload/download/cost estimation)
- **Wallet:** EVM wallet integration for payment operations

**Integration Status:**
- Previous agent forked Colony codebase and rebranded UI to "Aldr ID"
- Retained full Colony backend infrastructure (DataStore, KeyStore, Graph, PodManager)
- Added Aldr-specific wallet setup flow over Colony's initialization system
- Current issue: Multiple initialization calls causing database lock conflicts
